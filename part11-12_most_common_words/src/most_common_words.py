# List comprehension is an elegant way to define and create lists based on existing lists.
# List comprehension is generally more compact and faster than normal functions and loops for creating list.
# However, we should avoid writing very long list comprehensions in one line to ensure that code is user-friendly.
# Remember, every list comprehension can be rewritten in for loop, but every for loop canâ€™t be rewritten in the form of list comprehension.'''
